# Awesome MIT Open Source [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

A list that contains MIT license open source projects. 

You can use it for commercial use for free, and you don't need to open source your code.

> Some other license like `ISC License` is also included, because they are pretty much equal to `MIT License`.

> And for other license like `Apache License 2.0`, it is harder to use, but is also OK for commercial use, so I use the delete symbol to highlight them. Use them with cares.
